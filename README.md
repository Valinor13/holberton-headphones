# 0x04. Implement a design from scratch

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.  
  
You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.  

# Requirements
- We are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)  
- We are not to use Javascript

## Task 0: Read and be familiar with Figma  

Create an account in [Figma](https://figma.com)

**For this task, please write an amazing README.md** <br>
Find it [here.](https://github.com/Valinor13/holberton-headphones/blob/main/README.md)

**Interaction notes:**
- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: ```#FF6565```
- button hover/active: ```opacity: 0.9```
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page  
  
## Task 1: Header  
  
Building a web page the right way is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:
- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
- simple HTML structure - ```div``` containers are your friend!  


For this first task: **create the header/hero piece**  
  
## Task 2: "What we do..." section

Copy files from the previous task.

- For this second task: create the “What we do…” section
- In this section, we will need custom font icons.
<br>\*Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

## Task 3: "Our results" section

- Copy files from the previous task.
- For this third task: create the “Our results” section
- Now we can reuse components form the previous task!

## Task 4: Contact us

- Copy files from the previous task.
- A good landing page has always a contact form.
- We are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

## Task 5: Footer

- Copy files from the previous task.
- Last piece of the page… the Footer!
